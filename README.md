### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

## Who am I
Hello, Iâ€™m Ken.

## Background
I've been in software development for over 20 years, taking on various roles. My career started programming using Visual Basic 3, but for the last 10 years it's been mainly C#.

Working in various industries, I spent a couple of years doing a lot of network engineering, including an upgrade from NT4 to Windows 2000. This is where my interest in Software Architecture and Networking came from. These days I mainly works on backend systems implementing Web APIâ€™s using C# within Azure. I have an interest in DevOps, and automation around building and testing.

## Free time
Outside of work I enjoy medieval gunnery as part of a re-enactment group, and also enjoy a good afternoon tea.
